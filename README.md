# UnityDashPong
A non-commercial remake of DashPong made in Unity as my first project ever built in Unity and as a coursework

Only one instance of the game can be ran on the device simultaneously, but this can be avoided if one instance is ran in the Unity Editor

To start the server, run the AuthServer.exe from AuthServer/Debug folder

Then start up the game, put in preferred credentials,Sign In/Sign Up,and enjoy playing the game with your friends.

If the server host should desire, he can ban certain login by changing the corresponding value in the .db file(In the future it will become possible
to do from the server window, by running a command or something along those lines)
